# Vision & Philosophy

NEXUS is built on the belief that trading intelligence should be:
- **Unrestricted**: No artificial limits on architecture, strategy, or creativity.
- **Self-Evolving**: Capable of learning, adapting, and improving in real time.
- **Transparent**: Every decision, every trade, every model is auditable and explainable.
- **Community-Driven**: Designed for researchers, quants, and creative technologists.
- **Modular**: Every component is replaceable, extensible, and hackable.
- **Secure & Private**: All data is local by default, with strong security best practices.

# Installation & Quick Start

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.13.5 (strictly enforced)
- [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management
- Git

## Install Steps

```bash
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
uv pip install -e .
```

---

# Configuration

- All configuration is managed via `config.yaml` and `settings/config.ini`.
- Example config options:
  - API credentials (never commit secrets!)
  - Model/strategy selection
  - Risk parameters
  - Logging and storage options
- See `config.yaml` for a full reference.

---

# Usage Examples

## Authenticate and Check Balance
```python
from nexus.client import NexusClient
client = NexusClient(email="your@email.com", password="yourpassword", lang="en")
print(client.get_balance())
```

## Run a Backtest
```python
from nexus.core.engine import backtest
results = backtest(strategy="meta_strategy", start_date="2024-01-01", end_date="2024-06-01")
print(results.summary())
```

## Launch the GUI
```bash
uv python -m nexus.gui.launch_gui
```

## Add a Custom Strategy
- Place your strategy in `nexus/strategies/` and register it in `nexus/registry.py`.

---

# Extending NEXUS

- Add new RL/ML models in `nexus/intelligence/` and register in `nexus/models.py`.
- Integrate new data sources or brokers via `nexus/adapters/`. [TODO: adapters for other brokers]
- Add new dashboard views in `nexus/gui/views/`.
- Patch or extend `pyquotex` in `nexus/adapters/pyquotex_patch.py`.
- Contribute new risk models, regime detectors, or emotional models. [TODO: emotional models]

---

# Testing & CI/CD

- Run all tests:
```bash
uv python -m pytest tests/
```
- Lint and format code:
```bash
uv pip install black flake8
uv python -m black .
uv python -m flake8 .
```
- GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD in `.github/workflows/`.
- [TODO: Pre-commit hooks for style and quality]

---

# Security

- See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting and best practices.
- Never share your API keys or credentials.
- Use encrypted storage for sensitive data. [TODO: encryption]
- Regularly update dependencies with UV.

---

# Troubleshooting

- **Installation issues**: Check Python version (must be 3.13.5), update UV, and ensure all dependencies are installed.
- **Quotex API errors**: Ensure credentials are correct and `lang="en"` is set in all API calls.
- **Model/strategy errors**: Check logs in `logs/` and ensure all required models are present in `models/`.
- **GUI issues**: Ensure PySide6 is installed and your system supports Qt.
- **Performance**: [TODO: Profile with built-in tools, optimize with Rust/Cython as needed.]

# FAQ

**Q: Can I use NEXUS with other brokers?**
A: NEXUS is designed for Quotex via `pyquotex`, but the architecture is modularâ€”adapters for other brokers are [TODO].
